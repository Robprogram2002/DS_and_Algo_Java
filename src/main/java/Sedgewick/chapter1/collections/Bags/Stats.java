// The task is simply to compute the average and the sample standard deviation of the double values on standard input.
// If there are N numbers on standard input, their average is computed by adding the numbers and dividing by N; their
// sample standard deviation is computed by adding the squares of the difference between each number and the average,
// dividing by Nâ€“1, and taking the square root. The order in which the numbers are considered is not relevant for either
// of these calculations, so we save them in a Bag and use the foreach construct to compute each sum. Note : It is
// possible to compute the standard deviation without saving all the numbers
